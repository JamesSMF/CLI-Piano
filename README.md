# CLI-Piano

Actually it is more than a piano now. At first I intended to make a CLI piano just for fun. But I finally
decided to record my own voice and made it into a beat-box machine.

## How to use it

In mac terminal, clone the repo and use your favorite editor to open the piano.py file. Modify line 75 to
your current path of SOURCE folder.

Now you can run `python3 piano.py` and enjoy.
